## What's the purpose of this project?

This aims to be a better solution to a perceived problem of having my dns cache poisoned

In the commit [kubernetes: move all resources to the default namespace](https://github.com/ShaylenReddy42/Seelans-Tyres/commit/f0aceb8d6d7c46f198f4e904ed6c29d32f6e7785) of my Seelan's Tyres project, I said this:

  ".. after watching john savill's video "how dns works", i suspected my dns was poisoned so i started flushing it often, 
  then it got to a point where it seemed like it was being poisoned on a regular basis as my builds would hang, 
  and when i flushed my dns, it would proceed

  to solve this problem, i created a script to flush the dns, 
  and created a task in task scheduler to execute that script every minute indefinitely"

Though that solution works, it causes other problems like:
1. Flashing the terminal and losing focus
2. Causes the terminal [sometimes] to freeze and it builds up on each other

This obviously ruins my experience so I had to come up with another solution and this is it

It's a worker service that can be registered as a Windows Service that runs in the background executing `ipconfig /flushdns` every 30 seconds

This doesn't flash the terminal, and logs are sent to the Windows Event Logs

A much MUCH better solution
